Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program.
There are 2 types of modules in python:

Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.

For Example : calendar, math, datetime etc. are some of the Built in modules in Python.

External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.

For Example : pandas, tensorflow etc. are some of the External modules in Python.


The pip command
It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command
for Example: pip install pandas


Using a module in Python (Usage)
We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code:
```
import pandas                #importing pandas module

# Read and work with a file named 'words.csv'
df = pandas.read_csv('file1.csv')
print(df) # This will display first few rows from the words.csv file
```
Similarly we can install other modules and look into their documentations for usage instructions.
