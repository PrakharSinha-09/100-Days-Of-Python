What is a variable?
Variable is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar, salt etc Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value. In Python its as easy as writing:

a = 1
b = True
c = "Prakhar"
d = None
These are four variables of different data types.
