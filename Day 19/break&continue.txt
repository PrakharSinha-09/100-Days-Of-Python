The Break Statement:
The break statement enables a program to skip over a part of the code. A break statement terminates the very loop it lies within.

example
for i in range(1,101,1):
    print(i ,end=" ")
    if(i==50):
        break
    else:
        print("Hey There!")
print("See Yaa!")

output
1 Hey There!
2 Hey There!
3 Hey There!
4 Hey There!
5 Hey There!
.
.
.
50 Hey There!

See Yaa!


The Continue Statement:
The continue statement skips the rest of the loop statements and causes the next iteration to occur.

example
for i in [2,3,4,6,8,0]:
    if (i%2!=0):
        continue
    print(i)

output
2
4
6
8
0



iN A Nutshell:
ðŸ“Œcontinue statement skips the iteration if a given condition holds true for that particular iteration 
and control will be sent to the starting of the loop for next iteration.

ðŸ“Œbreak statement "breaks" or escape out of the loop if a condition encountered which holds true, for an iteration.
