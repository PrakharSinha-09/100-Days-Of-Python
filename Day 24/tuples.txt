Python Tuples
Tuples are ordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. 
Tuple items are separated by commas and enclosed within round brackets (). 
Tuples are immutable means unchangeable meaning we can not alter them after creation.

Example 1:
tuple1 = (1,2,2,3,5,4,6)
tuple2 = ("Red", "Green", "Blue")
print(tuple1)
print(tuple2)

Output:
(1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6)
('Red', 'Green', 'Blue')

Example 2:
details = ("Hello", 09, "Prakhar")
print(details)

Output:
('Hello', 09, 'Prakhar')
