Tuple methods
As tuple is immutable type of collection of elements it have limited built in methods.They are explained below

count() Method
The count() method of Tuple returns the number of times the given element appears in the tuple.

Syntax:
tuple.count(element)
Example
Tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2)
res = Tuple1.count(3)
print('Count of 3 in Tuple1 is:', res)

Output
3

index() method
The Index() method returns the first occurrence of the given element from the tuple.

Syntax:
tuple.index(element, start, end)
Note: This method raises a ValueError if the element is not found in the tuple.

Example
Tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2)
res = Tuple.index(3)
print('First occurrence of 3 is', res)

Output
3


tup=(2,4,5,6,7,8,9,9)
📌If we want to see in some sub tuple, we can do it too by slicing
print(tup.index(6,3,6))               
👉first argument is, number you want to serach, second arg is the starting index and lastly we have end index

Output:
3

len() method returns the length of the tuple
tup=(2,4,5,6,7,8,9,9)
print(len(tup))

Output:
8
