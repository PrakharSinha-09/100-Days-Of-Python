Write a program to clear the clutter inside a folder on your computer. You should use os module to rename all the txt files from 1.txt all the way till n.txt where n is the number of txt files in that folder. Do the same for other file formats. 

For example: 
sf.txt --> 1.txt
vfsf.txt --> 2.txt 
this.txt --> 3.txt 
design.txt --> 4.txt 
name.txt --> 5.txt

In My CodeBase, i've changed the names of file having extension .txt
