📌self parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

🎯Remember:
👉It must be provided as the extra parameter inside the method definition.
👉self is the keyword, which is always required when we define a function inside a class

Example:
class Details:
    name = "Rohan"
    age = 20

    def desc(self):
        print("My name is", self.name, "and I'm", self.age, "years old.")

obj1 = Details()
obj1.desc()

Output:
My name is Rohan and I'm 20 years old.
